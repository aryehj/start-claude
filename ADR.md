## ADR-001: Set `UV_CACHE_DIR` to a writable path in the container environment

**Date:** 2026-04-03
**Status:** Accepted

### Context

Inside the container, Claude Code's sandbox restricts `/root/.cache` to
read-only. UV defaults to `/root/.cache/uv` for its cache directory. Every
`uv run` invocation fails with:

```
error: Failed to initialize cache at `/root/.cache/uv`
  Caused by: failed to create directory `/root/.cache/uv`: Read-only file system (os error 30)
```

Claude Code would then spend multiple tool calls trying to work around this
(prefixing `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/...` on individual commands), burning context and
often still failing when it forgot the prefix.

### Decision

Set `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/uv-cache` at multiple levels:

1. **`TERM_ARGS` (`-e UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/uv-cache`)** — passed to both
   `container run` and `container exec`. This is the critical path: Claude Code
   inherits the container's environment, and all `bash -c` subprocesses it spawns
   inherit it in turn.
2. **`/root/.bashrc`** — interactive login shells inside the container.
3. **`/etc/environment`** — PAM-based login sessions.
4. **`/etc/profile.d/uv-cache.sh`** — login shells sourcing profile.d.

Layer 1 is sufficient for Claude Code's sandbox. Layers 2-4 are
belt-and-suspenders for manual shell sessions.

### Consequences

- `uv run`, `uv pip`, and `uvx` work out of the box inside the sandbox with no
  manual `UV_CACHE_DIR` prefix.
- The cache lives under `/tmp/uv-cache`, which is writable but ephemeral — it
  does not survive container restarts. This is acceptable because UV
  re-downloads packages quickly and the cache is not large.
- Requires `--rebuild` to take effect on existing containers.
