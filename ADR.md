## ADR-001: Set `UV_CACHE_DIR` to a writable path in the container environment

**Date:** 2026-04-03
**Status:** Accepted

### Context

Inside the container, Claude Code's sandbox restricts `/root/.cache` to
read-only. UV defaults to `/root/.cache/uv` for its cache directory. Every
`uv run` invocation fails with:

```
error: Failed to initialize cache at `/root/.cache/uv`
  Caused by: failed to create directory `/root/.cache/uv`: Read-only file system (os error 30)
```

Claude Code would then spend multiple tool calls trying to work around this
(prefixing `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/...` on individual commands), burning context and
often still failing when it forgot the prefix.

### Decision

Set `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/uv-cache` at multiple levels:

1. **`TERM_ARGS` (`-e UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/uv-cache`)** — passed to both
   `container run` and `container exec`. This is the critical path: Claude Code
   inherits the container's environment, and all `bash -c` subprocesses it spawns
   inherit it in turn.
2. **`/root/.bashrc`** — interactive login shells inside the container.
3. **`/etc/environment`** — PAM-based login sessions.
4. **`/etc/profile.d/uv-cache.sh`** — login shells sourcing profile.d.

Layer 1 is sufficient for Claude Code's sandbox. Layers 2-4 are
belt-and-suspenders for manual shell sessions.

### Consequences

- `uv run`, `uv pip`, and `uvx` work out of the box inside the sandbox with no
  manual `UV_CACHE_DIR` prefix.
- The cache lives under `/tmp/uv-cache`, which is writable but ephemeral — it
  does not survive container restarts. This is acceptable because UV
  re-downloads packages quickly and the cache is not large.
- Requires `--rebuild` to take effect on existing containers.

## ADR-002: Add `/tmp/uv-cache` to sandbox `filesystem.allowWrite`

**Date:** 2026-04-03
**Status:** Accepted

### Context

ADR-001 set `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/uv-cache` as an environment variable, but this
alone was insufficient. Claude Code's bubblewrap sandbox mounts most of `/tmp`
as read-only. The env var told uv *where* to write, but the sandbox prevented
the actual writes:

```
error: Failed to initialize cache at `/tmp/uv-cache`
  Caused by: failed to create directory `/tmp/uv-cache`: Read-only file system (os error 30)
```

Setting `$TMPDIR` (`/tmp/claude`) also failed — the sandbox restricts that path
for its own use.

### Decision

Add `/tmp/uv-cache` to `sandbox.filesystem.allowWrite` in each project's
`.claude/settings.local.json`. The script now:

1. **New projects:** The generated `settings.local.json` includes the
   `filesystem.allowWrite` array with `/tmp/uv-cache`.
2. **Existing projects:** The migration block in `start-claude.sh` checks for
   the presence of `/tmp/uv-cache` in `allowWrite` and adds it if missing,
   alongside the existing boolean→object migration.

### Consequences

- `uv` commands work inside the sandbox without any manual workarounds.
- The env var (`UV_CACHE_DIR`) and sandbox permission (`filesystem.allowWrite`)
  are now kept in sync by the same script.
- Existing containers need their `settings.local.json` updated (happens
  automatically on next `start-claude.sh` run) but do not require `--rebuild`.

## ADR-003: Set theme in project-level settings, not global `.claude.json`

**Date:** 2026-04-03
**Status:** Accepted

### Context

The script previously set `"theme": "light"` by overwriting `/root/.claude.json`
on every `container run`:

```bash
bash -c 'echo "{\"theme\":\"light\"}" > /root/.claude.json && exec bash'
```

`/root/.claude.json` is a top-level file, separate from the `/root/.claude/`
directory that is volume-mounted for credential persistence. Because `.claude.json`
was not persisted, it was ephemeral — but it also meant the overwrite destroyed
any auth-related state that Claude Code wrote there (e.g. `oauthAccount`,
`hasCompletedOnboarding`), potentially contributing to re-login prompts on
container recreation.

Mounting `.claude.json` as a second volume was considered but adds complexity
(seeding the file, merging settings across versions).

### Decision

Move the theme setting to the project-level `settings.local.json`, which the
script already creates and migrates. The `container run` entrypoint is now plain
`bash` with no file writes.

- New projects get `"theme": "light"` in the generated `settings.local.json`.
- Existing projects get it added by the migration block (same pattern as the
  sandbox and `allowWrite` migrations).

### Consequences

- `.claude.json` is no longer touched by the script. Claude Code manages it
  internally; its contents are ephemeral to each container but no longer
  clobbered on creation.
- Theme is project-scoped, which is how `settings.local.json` is designed to
  work. Different projects could theoretically use different themes.
- Auth persistence depends solely on the `~/.claude/` volume mount (which
  contains `.credentials.json`). If `.claude.json` turns out to hold state
  required for session continuity, a separate volume mount would need to be
  added.
